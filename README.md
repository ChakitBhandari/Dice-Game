# Dice-Game
1. I've crafted a simple game employing HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
2. The game incorporates a random number generator to yield numbers between 1 and 6 on two dice, representing two participants. The participant with the higher number prevails as the winner, while the other experiences defeat.
3. Upon each page refresh, a fresh set of random numbers is generated on the two dice. Should both dice display identical numbers, the game concludes in a tie.
